## Introduction

The "Poetry Generator with Markov Models" is a Python-based project that utilizes Markov models to generate unique and creative poetry. This project is designed for enthusiasts of both poetry and machine learning, offering a playful intersection of the two domains. Using text data from a collection of poetry, the generator creates new compositions that mirror the style and thematic elements of the source material.
